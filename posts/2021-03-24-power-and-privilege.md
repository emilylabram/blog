# My tips for empowering, inclusive and effective product workshops

Over the past few months I've been experimenting with how I set vision, goals and roadmap with teams.

My inspiration comes thanks to [Sonia Turcotte](https://twitter.com/sonia_turcotte) and [Clara Greo](https://twitter.com/claragt), who ran a fantastic course on "Power and Privilege" last year.

Here are seven things that have made my workshops more empowering, inclusive and effective.

## 1. Start planning early

I used to procrastinate over planning workshops as I felt I had to do it all myself. I'd leave it until the night before and prep slides until late.

This last-minuteness created stress for my team - especially the introverts. 

I now realise that starting early is fundamental to making workshops inclusive. 

I create an "agenda" doc and share it immediately. This enables the team to challenge the plan, suggest improvements and prepare themselves.

Planning ahead reduces stress and enables us to begin workshops confident and united.

## 2. Plan with others

I used to think it was the Product Manager's job to design and facilitate workshops. I worried I'd be "burdening" others by involving them. 

Unfortunately, doing it myself disempowered others on my team who would have wanted more responsibility.

These days, I know that involving colleagues in planning workshops allows them to shine. I team up with at least one person to plan every workshop. Recently, that was the brilliant Ciaran McCabe, Delivery Manager on the Verify team.

The process instantly becomes more joyful, creative and effective.

We also offer opportunities to others in the team to plan parts of the workshop.

Recently, we delegated part of the workshop to our Senior Performance Analyst. He invented a "Snakes and Ladders" game to help the team break down an epic. 

Later, it gave me great pleasure to see him present the end results to the rest of the programme: proof that people of all disciplines can grow through doing Product Management.

Teams love to experience workshops created by fellow team members - especially developers. So it's a win-win-win.

## 3. Use playbooks

Creating workshops from scratch is great fun but incredibly time-consuming. It's also riskier than picking up something tried and tested.

This is where playbooks come in.

The one I'm most familiar with is [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/). 

I've also found the [Atlassian playbook](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook) useful as a starting point. 

And just recently, I purchased [Beyond Sticky Notes: Co-design for Real: Mindsets, methods and movements](https://www.beyondstickynotes.com/tellmemore) which I hope will be another source.

## 4. Train up facilitators

Having a diverse group of facilitators livens up a workshop. It also gives team members the chance to practice their facilitation skills.

Be specific about the request, in advance. This will encourage team members with less confidence to volunteer.

E.g. "We need three volunteers tomorrow to host three break-out groups. You'll explain the activity and keep time. Here's a link to the exercise. We'll talk you through it after stand-up."

## 5. Encourage playfulness

When I used to plan and run workshops alone, I would make jokes to liven up the atmosphere. These often fell flat so I gave up and kept things serious. What I didn't realise was that empowering everyone is what makes playfulness possible.

These days, I make space for silliness throughout the process. 

For example, Ciaran recently came up with a "Doomsday" prioritisation exercise. We imagined what would happen if the whole team failed to come to work. This was a brilliant way to consider the "cost of not doing" our existing work. The playful way Ciaran facilitated the exercise brought out playfulness in the rest of the team. This made it a bonding experience, as well as productive.

## 6. Delegate follow-up

In the past, I would find myself alone with a stack of post-its after a workshop, thinking "what now?" 

These days, I make sure the team decides what happens next and takes on as much as possible themselves.

The Liberating Structure ["What, So what, Now what?"](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/) is a great exercise for this.

And if there are specific tasks I might normally do, I consider who else might want to help. 

For example, after a session on the team's "hopes and dreams" for the quarter, our Technical Writer wrote up the findings into a mission statement.

## 7. Be gentle with yourself

Sometimes, circumstances make it impossible to follow these tips. In these moments, it's OK to revert to top-down shortcuts. Yes, it's less effective and it's sad to see morale decline. But the important thing - I've learned - is to notice the degree of empowerment achieved despite the constraints. 

So, those are my tips!

When these things come together, it's delightful how teams blossom into creativity. We typically leave the session on a high, feeling like "everyone had a voice" and impressed with the results. One developer noticed we'd created "the clearest priorities" he'd seen in three years.
