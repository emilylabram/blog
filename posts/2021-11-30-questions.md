# How to ask questions in public that energise everyone and get the results you want (3 minute read)

## Introduction

### Why bother asking a question in public?

Asking questions is the quickest way for anyone in an organisation to improve their visibility - no matter how new or junior they are.

Done well, it's rewarding. You feel the satisfaction of raising something that others care about.

It's also effective. A great question energises the whole room. 50, 100, 500 people feel a sense of togetherness and the whoosh of excitement about making things better. You'll often find a Senior Leader prompting you: what do you think? How can we make this happen? And from there, instant permission to get things done.

We want as many people as possible asking great questions. Especially those who feel most nervous about it.

This post will help you start.

### OK, but it's scary!

Yes! You're right to be scared. 

Asking questions in public is EXTREMELY RISKY. 

When I was 22, I asked my CEO a question that was so naive and misguided that the entire room turned to stone. The CEO had to pause for several seconds to process his disbelief. Everyone in that meeting avoided me for weeks. It took months to restore my reputation and I still cringe about it TEN YEARS LATER.

That wasn't the only time I've messed up. I've been too grumpy, too basic, I've blanked, I've gabbled.

But for personal reasons* I kept going, asking hundreds of questions over the past ten years - and in the end, I found a formula that works for me.

## 1: start listening to your senior leaders




## 2: think of some questions in advance



## 3: Make sure they're the right kind of question

A good question to a CEO should be both "collective" and "strategic":

"Collective" means that it's relevant to as many people as possible in the room. A good example would be an opportunity that relates to the organisation's vision. A bad example would be an issue with career progression that affects only you.

"Strategic" means that you're engaging with how the organisation can be successful at what it does. Again, good subjects are things to do with vision, strategy and objectives. A bad example would be a complaint about not having enough bike storage at the office. These issues matter too, but leaders rarely have good answers when put on the spot. You're better off raising them outside of public events.

## 4. Do a messy first draft

"Ugh. Yet again we're hearing about big visions with no way to measure success!"

## 2. Reframe

Find the outcome you want
Describe the challenges

## 3. Assess the risk

How sensitive is this issue right now?
Has this question been asked before?
