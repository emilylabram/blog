# My tips for empowering, inclusive and effective product workshops

Over the past few months I've been experimenting how I set vision, goals and roadmap with teams.

My inspiration comes thanks to Sonia and Clara, who ran a fantastic course for Product Managers called "Power and Privilege" last year.

In this post, I share the tips that have transformed my workshops from "top-down torture" to collective brilliance.

## 1. Start planning early

I used to procrastinate over planning workshops as I felt I had to do it all myself (wrong) and got totally overwhelmed. Often, I'd end up having to facilitate it all myself because I left it too late to ask others.

The last-minuteness also made it a bumpier ride for my team - especially the introverts. They would have 90 minute calendar invites inserted at short notice with agendas arriving minutes before the meeting. It was a risky approach that created stress all round.

I now realise that starting early means I can involve others and give participants the best possible information in advance. I now create an "agenda" doc and share it immediately so that participants can challenge the plan and suggest ways to make it more inclusive. 

These tweaks have reduced stress and enabled us to begin workshops confident and united.

## 2. Plan with others

I used to think it was the Product Manager's job to design and facilitate workshops, and that I'd be "burdening" others by involving them. It pains me to realise that this disempowered my counterpart Delivery Manager, who would have relished the chance to create workshops with me. And there may well have been other colleagues with an interest in developing facilitation skills who would have wanted to help.

These days, I consider what I think the team needs from a workshop and then team up with at least one person to plan it. Recently, that was the brilliant Ciaran McCabe, Delivery Manager on the Verify team.

The process instantly became more joyful, creative and effective.

Ciaran and I have also offered opportunities to others in the team to create workshops with us. Recently, we delegated part of the workshop to our Senior Performance Analyst, who invented a "Snakes and Ladders" game to help the team break down an epic. Later, it gave me great pleasure to see him present the end results to the rest of the programme: proof that people of all disciplines can grow through doing Product Management.

Teams love to experience workshops created by fellow team members so it's a win-win-win.

## 2. Use playbooks

Creating workshops from scratch is great fun but incredibly time-consuming. It's also riskier than picking up something tried and tested.

This is where playbooks come in.

The one I'm most familiar with is Liberating Structures. I've also used the Atlassian playbook and customised it. And just recently, I purchased [Beyond Sticky Notes: Co-design for Real: Mindsets, methods and movements] (https://www.beyondstickynotes.com/tellmemore) which I hope will be another source.

## 3. Train up facilitators

Having a diverse group of facilitators livens up a workshop. It reduces pressure on the planners and give everyone the chance to practice their facilitation skills.

Be specific about the request, in advance. This will encourage team members with less confidence to volunteer.

E.g. "We need three volunteers tomorrow to host three break-out groups. You'll explain the activity and keep time. Here's a link to the exercise. We'll talk you through it after stand-up."

## 4. Encourage playfulness

When I used to plan and run workshops alone, I would try to make jokes and liven up the atmosphere and these often fell flat. So I stopped and kept things grimly focused on getting things done. Oh dear!

These days, I make space for silliness in the creative process. Ciaran, for example, came up with a "Doomsday" prioritisation exercise where we imagined the whole team failed to come to work, indefinitely - in order to reveal the relative cost of "not doing" our work. 

## 5. Empower the team to shape what happens next

In the past, I would find myself alone with a stack of post-its after a workshop, thinking "what now?" and feeling completely overwhelmed.

These days, I make sure the team decides on what happens next and takes it on themselves.

"What, So what, now what?" is a great exercise to agree this.

And if there are specific tasks I might normally do - e.g. "drafting the objectives and key results" - I now remember who else might want to help. For example, after a session on the team's "hopes and dreams" for the quarter, our Technical Writer wrote up the findings into a mission statement.

## 6. Be gentle with yourself

Sometimes, circumstances make it impossible to follow these tips. In these moments, it's OK to revert to top-down shortcuts. Yes, it feels miserable compared to what's possible. But the important thing - I've learned - is to pick myself up and remember that it's the degree of empowerment I'm able to create despite the constraints that matters. Not whether a workshop is "as good as" one I've run before, or "as good as it possibly could be".

So, those are my tips!

When these things come together, it's delightful to see my teams blossom into creativity. We typically leave the session on a high, with participants feeling like "everyone had a voice". One developer felt we ended with "the clearest set of priorities in three years."

Thanks again to Sonia, Clara and the designer [George Aye](https://medium.com/greater-good-studio/design-educations-big-gap-understanding-the-role-of-power-1ee1756b7f08) for showing me how it's done.
