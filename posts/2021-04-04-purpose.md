# Finding your purpose as a Product Manager (work in progress)
A step by step guide

Thanks to Kate Turner my brilliant coach.

## Why I did this work

## 1. Go back in time

Remember your "sweetest" memories as as child.

Two examples:

Learning how to weave 

Dancing around a May Pole

## 2. Draft your values

What do these memories tell me about my values?

What words come to mind?

Pick 5 words that resonate the most

Then play with them

## 3. Draft your roles

What does it look like to live your values?

What roles would you need to play?

Brainstorm lots of examples.

Pick one for each value.

Then play with them.

## 4. Draft your purpose

What does it look like to live your roles?

What would you be doing?

Draft a sentence that describes what you do.

Then play with it.

## 5. Draft your vision

Imagine yourself 10 years from now.


## 6. Set a "theme" 

## 7. Take baby steps

## 8. Reward yourself
