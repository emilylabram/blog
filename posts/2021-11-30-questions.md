# 7 tips for asking great questions in public (3 minute read)

## Introduction

### Why bother asking questions in public?

Asking questions is the quickest way to improve your visibility in your organisation.

It can be extremely rewarding to raise something that others care about.

It's also an effective way to make change happen.

A great question energises the whole room. 50, 100, 500 people feel a sense of togetherness and the whoosh of excitement about making things better. 

When you ask a great question, you'll hear a Senior Leader prompting you: what do you think? How can we make this happen? Often, you'll get instant permission to get things done - and you'll build a great reputation along the way.

So we want as many people as possible asking great questions. Especially those who feel most nervous about it. Your voices are the ones we most need to hear.

This post will help you build your confidence and start practising.

### OK, but it's scary!

Yes! You're right to be scared. 

Asking questions in public is EXTREMELY RISKY. 

When I was 22, I asked my CEO a question that was so naive and misguided that the entire room turned to stone. 

The CEO had to pause for several seconds to process his disbelief. 

Everyone in that meeting avoided me for weeks. 

It took months to restore my reputation and I still cringe about it TEN YEARS LATER.

That wasn't the only time I've messed up. I've been too grumpy, too basic, I've blanked, I've gabbled.

I've asked hundreds of questions over the past ten years, and I've always meant to write down the tips that work for me.

I know I've had it easier because of the privileges on my side. But I hope they can still be useful.

## 1: think about your organisation's strategy

Believe in yourself. No one is too junior to engage in strategy.

## 2: think of some questions in advance



## 3: Make sure they're the right kind of question

A good question to a CEO should be both "collective" and "strategic":

"Collective" means that it's relevant to as many people as possible in the room. A good example would be an opportunity that relates to the organisation's vision. A bad example would be an issue with career progression that affects only you.

"Strategic" means that you're engaging with how the organisation can be successful at what it does. Again, good subjects are things to do with vision, strategy and objectives. A bad example would be a complaint about not having enough bike storage at the office. These issues matter too, but leaders rarely have good answers when put on the spot. You're better off raising them outside of public events.

## 4. Do a messy first draft

"Ugh. Yet again we're hearing about big visions with no way to measure success!"

## 5. Reframe

Find the outcome you want
Describe the challenges

## 6. Choose your audience

How sensitive is this issue right now?
Has this question been asked before?

## 7. Other tips

* Be vulnerable
* Assume the best
* Check your reasoning
* Ground yourself
* Raise your energy
